# Context projects and problems

- This repository contains all the problems and projects from the App Academy Open bootcamp related to context and OOP.

- Docs provided by app academy are in each one of the folders of the rep.

- If you make a working local copy of the rep and have node installed, you can run the games by moving into their folder and running node game.js from console.

- Both games use the Screen API to create console aplications.
